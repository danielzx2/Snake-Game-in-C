# Snake-Game-in-C
Snake Game Project in the C Language

THE PLAN

1. Check code from labwork 3 & see potential uses (What ports?)
2. Test the pixels in display, find out the size of display in pixels (Test it with an vector!)
3. Start coding! (Function for snake, food, walls including tail as obstacle?)
4. Implement?
